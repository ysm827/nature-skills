# `nature-downloader` Skill

[中文说明](README.md)

`nature-downloader` obtains paper full text, PDFs, HTML full text, or auditable download status through open-access routes or the user's own institution-authorized access.

## What To Use It For

- Configure a school library, CARSI, EZproxy, WebVPN, or resource-portal entry point for first use.
- Reuse the user's logged-in Chrome institutional session to download legally accessible PDFs.
- Try to obtain full text from DOI, title, publisher page, PubMed page, or CNKI Chinese title.
- Save HTML/text or explain access status when no PDF is available.
- Report why access failed: no permission, user login required, CAPTCHA, human verification, or missing holdings.

## Typical Requests

- "Configure my university library entry point so future paper downloads can reuse it."
- "Use my logged-in Chrome session to download PDFs for these DOIs into the current project."
- "Use the authorized CNKI route for this Chinese paper; save it if possible and explain why if not."

## What You Need To Provide

- DOI, title, paper page link, or Chinese paper title.
- Library database entry point or logged-in Chrome session.
- Target output directory and naming preference.

## Outputs

- Local PDF, HTML, or text file.
- Access path, save path, and failure reason for each paper.
- Reusable school-entry configuration, usually at `~/.config/lit-dl/school.json`.

## Runtime and Dependencies

- First-time setup can use `scripts/configure_school.py` to identify and save resource entry points.
- Real downloading depends on local browser login state and available web-access / CDP control.
- Chinese papers default to the user's authorized CNKI or library CNKI entry point.

## Boundaries

- The skill does not bypass paywalls, use mirror sites, break CAPTCHA, or read/export cookies, passwords, localStorage, or session files.
- Unified identity login, CARSI, CAPTCHA, Cloudflare, SMS, or OTP challenges must be completed by the user in the browser.
- Without legal access, the skill only reports status and possible alternatives.
